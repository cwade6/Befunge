The arrow keys are the parts of the program that picks the driection they run as it can run in multiple directions.
You can run this program in the command line by running benfunge(program) with program being a doc string program or the variable name of a program. For example befunge(""" "!dlroW ,olleH">:v
                |,<
                @  """) works or program = """ "!dlroW ,olleH">:v
                |,<
                @  """    befunge(program) works
Sample programs can be found in the file tiltled sample programs. The docstrings are written so you can copy paste them to run on the command line.
